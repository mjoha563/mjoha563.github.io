<h2>Biographical/Family Information</h2>
<p>I was born and raised in Seneca, South Carolina. From my and my sister's earliest years, our dad taught us about Christianity and why he believed it was true.
However, he was always clear about his philosopy for our upringing: "I'm not teaching you what to think; I'm teaching you how to think." He deeply
believed that if we learned how to think, we would eventually come to the same conclusions that he did.
</p>
<p>
Ever since, I've been a thinker--always pondering and questioning. I'm rarely satisfied with an "I don't know." Over the years, I've asked many tough questions about Chistianity.
And though there are many questions that have yet to be resolved, I have realized that the answers found in Jesus Christ are enough for me. My dad was right. He equipped me with the mental
tools, and I eventually landed right where he did so many years ago.</p>
